This is a fourier transform based sound editing code.

How to use it?

1. Open file assets/recoring.py and run it. After on your terminal you see a message "started", you may start recording what ever you want

2. To check your recording you can open file 'recording0.wav'

3. Now open file assets/change_array run this file and the first thing you will see is a chart of your recording. After closing this chart another chart
will pop out. This chart is the fourier transform of your recording. You can change this fourier transform array on line 49 where i have explained how
to change the value of the elements in the fourier transform array. After closing this plot you will get a plot of a new recording bassed on the changes
in the fourier transform array
